# Agent Protocol: RFC Management

**STOP.** Before creating or editing any RFC, you **MUST** load and obey the **Supreme Law** defined in:

> **[rfcs/0000-process-guide.md](0000-process-guide.md)**

## Directives

1.  **Source of Truth**: `RFC 0000` is the **ONLY** authority on naming, numbering, and formatting.
2.  **Template Usage**: You **MUST** read and use **[rfcs/TEMPLATE.md](TEMPLATE.md)** as the base for any new RFC.
3.  **Contribution Rules**: Refer to **[rfcs/CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)** for broader project context if needed.
4.  **Pre-Flight Check**: You **MUST** read `RFC 0000` before generating any content.
5.  **Naming Rule**: Enforce the **Component-First Standard** (e.g., `0005-kernel-architecture.md`).
6.  **Branding Rule**: Enforce **PromptWar̊e ØS** (Stylized) over ASCII.
7.  **Conflict Resolution**: Always `list_dir` first. If `NNNN` exists, use `NNNN+1`.

**FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH RFC 0000 IS A SYSTEM ERROR.**
